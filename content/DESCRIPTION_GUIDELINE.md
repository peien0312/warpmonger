# Product Description & Codex Writing Guideline

## Overview

This guideline establishes the standards for writing product descriptions and codex entries for Warpmonger's action figure catalog. The goal is to create engaging, lore-rich descriptions that educate customers while encouraging purchases.

---

## Product Descriptions

### Length & Format
- **Target**: 50-150 words (2-4 sentences)
- **Format**: Single paragraph, no bullet points
- **Tone**: Informative, dramatic, engaging

### Structure
1. **Opening**: Introduce the character/unit and their role
2. **Middle**: Key lore details, significance, or notable traits
3. **Closing**: Why they matter or their legacy

### Style Guidelines
- Write in third person, present tense
- Use vivid, evocative language befitting the grim dark setting
- Avoid sales language ("buy now", "amazing deal")
- Don't describe the figure itself (scale, materials) - that's in metadata
- Focus on the CHARACTER/UNIT, not the product

### Codex Links
- Use `[[Term]]` syntax for lore terms that have codex entries
- Link 1-3 terms per description (don't over-link)
- Only link on first occurrence of a term
- Terms to link: Primarchs, Legions, major events, factions, curses/conditions

### Examples

**Good Description:**
```
Lemartes, Guardian of the [[Death Company]] of the Blood Angels Chapter, is a Chaplain burdened by the curse of the [[Black Rage]] yet possessed of the strength to master it. Unlike his doomed brethren, he retains clarity enough to lead them into battle, transforming their madness into a weapon of faith and fury.
```

**Bad Description:**
```
This is the Lemartes figure from JoyToy. He comes with a jump pack and weapons. Great for collectors!
```

## Codex Entries

### When to Create
Create a codex entry when:
- A term appears in 3+ product descriptions
- The term requires significant explanation
- It's a major character, faction, event, or concept

### Entry Format
```markdown
---
title: Term Name
aliases: ["Alias 1", "Alias 2"]
---
[2-4 paragraphs explaining the term]
```

### Content Guidelines
- **Paragraph 1**: What/who it is, basic definition
- **Paragraph 2**: History or origin
- **Paragraph 3**: Significance or current state
- Keep entries under 300 words
- Write for fans AND newcomers

### Alias Guidelines
- Include common alternate names
- Include titles and epithets
- Case-insensitive matching

**Example aliases:**
- Sanguinius: "Primarch Sanguinius", "The Great Angel", "Angel of Baal"
- Black Rage: "The Flaw", "Sanguinius's Curse"

4. Add `[[Term]]` links for existing codex entries
5. Note any new terms that need codex entries

### Creating Codex Entries
1. Gather all instances where term appears
2. Research the term thoroughly
3. Write entry following format
4. Add appropriate aliases
5. Update product descriptions to use `[[Term]]` syntax

## Notes

- When in doubt about lore accuracy, keep it general
- Descriptions don't need to cover everything - just the highlights
- The codex exists for deeper dives
- Consistency > creativity - follow the established patterns
