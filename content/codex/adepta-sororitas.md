The Adepta Sororitas, commonly known as the Sisters of Battle, are the militant arm of the Ecclesiarchy, the state church of the Imperium of Man. They are an all-female order of warriors who serve as the military wing of the Adeptus Ministorum, dedicated to the worship and defense of the God-Emperor.

Founded in the aftermath of the Age of Apostasy, the Sororitas arose from the Daughters of the Emperor, personal bodyguards of the renegade High Lord Goge Vandire. After his downfall, these warriors were reformed into the Orders Militant of the Ecclesiarchy. Their creation was a direct response to the Decree Passive, which forbade the Ecclesiarchy from maintaining "men under arms" — a loophole the Sororitas exploit by being exclusively female.

Armed with bolters, flamers, and unwavering faith, the Sisters of Battle are renowned for their fanatical devotion and acts of martyrdom. They fight alongside the Imperial Guard, Space Marines, and Inquisition, purging heretics, witches, and xenos wherever they are found.
