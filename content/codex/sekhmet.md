The Sekhmet, also known as the Scarab Occult, were the elite Terminator warriors of the Thousand Sons Legion. Unlike other Legion terminators, every Sekhmet was a powerful psyker, able to combine devastating psychic attacks with the formidable armament of Terminator armor. They served as the Magnus's personal guard and the Legion's most devastating assault force. Their Achea force weapons channeled their psychic might into every blow.
