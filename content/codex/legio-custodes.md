The Legio Custodes, also known as the Custodian Guard, are the personal bodyguard of the Emperor of Mankind. Created using the Emperor's own gene-craft, each Custodian is a masterwork of genetic engineering, superior to even the Space Marines. They wear auramite armor of incomparable quality and wield weapons forged by the greatest artisans of Terra. During the Horus Heresy, they fought alongside the Emperor in the final defense of Terra, never wavering in their eternal duty.
