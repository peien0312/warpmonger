Belisarius Cawl is an Archmagos Dominus of the Adeptus Mechanicus and one of the most brilliant — and controversial — Tech-Priests in Imperial history. Over ten thousand years old, Cawl has extended his lifespan through countless cybernetic augmentations, absorbing the knowledge and personalities of numerous other Tech-Priests into his own consciousness.

Shortly after the Horus Heresy, Cawl was secretly commissioned by Roboute Guilliman to work on two monumental projects: improving upon the Emperor's original Space Marine design, and finding a way to restore Guilliman himself should the Primarch ever fall. For ten millennia, Cawl labored in secret, eventually perfecting the Primaris Space Marines — larger, stronger, and more resilient than their predecessors.

When Guilliman was finally resurrected during the 13th Black Crusade, Cawl unveiled his creations to the galaxy. His relationship with the Mechanicus is complicated; many Tech-Priests view his innovations as tech-heresy, while others see him as the Omnissiah's chosen instrument. Cawl himself seems unconcerned with such debates, focused only on advancing his understanding of the universe.
