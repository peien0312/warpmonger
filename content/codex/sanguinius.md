Sanguinius, Primarch of the Blood Angels and known as the Great Angel, was perhaps the most beloved of all the Emperor's sons. Blessed with magnificent white wings and angelic beauty, he embodied nobility and virtue while harboring a terrible secret—the Red Thirst that afflicted his Legion. During the Siege of Terra, Sanguinius confronted Horus himself aboard the Vengeful Spirit and, though he fell in battle, his sacrifice helped weaken the Warmaster enough for the Emperor to deliver the final blow. His death transformed him into a martyred saint revered across the Imperium.
