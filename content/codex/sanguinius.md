Primarch of the IX Legion: Sanguinius led the Blood Angels, one of the Emperor's twenty Space Marine Legions. He was a brilliant commander and beloved figure, often seen as embodying the Emperor's noblest qualities. At the Siege of Terra, Sanguinius confronted Warmaster Horus aboard the Vengeful Spirit. Though mortally wounded and slain, his sacrifice weakened Horus, paving the way for the Emperor's final battle. His death left a psychic imprint on the Blood Angels, manifesting as the Red Thirst and Black Rage, curses that haunt the Chapter to this day.
