Roboute Guilliman is the Primarch of the Ultramarines Legion and currently serves as the Lord Commander of the Imperium — the de facto ruler of mankind's realm in the 41st Millennium. Created by the Emperor of Mankind during the Great Crusade, Guilliman was renowned as both a peerless military commander and a masterful statesman, authoring the Codex Astartes that governs Space Marine organization to this day.

During the Horus Heresy, Guilliman remained loyal to the Emperor, though his Legion arrived too late to participate in the Siege of Terra. In the subsequent Scouring, he led Imperial forces against the traitors before being mortally wounded by his traitorous brother Fulgrim. Placed in stasis within the Temple of Correction on Macragge, Guilliman remained suspended between life and death for ten thousand years.

In 999.M41, during the 13th Black Crusade, Guilliman was finally healed through the combined efforts of the Ynnari — Eldar death-cultists — and the technology of Archmagos Belisarius Cawl. Awakening to an Imperium far darker than he remembered, Guilliman has since launched the Indomitus Crusade and struggles to reform the corrupt, stagnant bureaucracy that rules in his father's name.
