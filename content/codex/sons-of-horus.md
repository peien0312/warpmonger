The Sons of Horus, formerly the Luna Wolves, were the XVI Legion of the Space Marine Legions and the personal army of Warmaster Horus. Once among the most celebrated of the Emperor's forces, they were the first Legion to fall to Chaos during the Horus Heresy. Known for their aggressive close-quarters tactics and the distinctive sea-green of their armor, the Sons of Horus became the spearhead of the Traitor forces. Their elite Justaerin Terminators and Reavers were feared throughout the galaxy for their brutal efficiency and unwavering loyalty to the Warmaster.
