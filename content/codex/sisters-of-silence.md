The Sisters of Silence are psychic blanks, women born without any presence in the Warp. This null aura makes them anathema to psykers and daemons, causing intense discomfort and even death to those who rely on psychic power. They served alongside the Legio Custodes as part of the Talons of the Emperor, hunting rogue psykers and containing Warp-tainted threats. Their vow of silence gives them their name, for they communicate only through sign language.
