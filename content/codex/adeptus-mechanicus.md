The Adeptus Mechanicus is the technological arm of the Imperium of Man, a vast organization of Tech-Priests who worship the Machine God — the Omnissiah — whom they believe to be an aspect of the Emperor himself. Based on the forge world of Mars, the Mechanicus controls all significant manufacturing, maintains the Imperium's technology, and guards the secrets of machines with religious fervor.

The Tech-Priests of the Mechanicus replace their flesh with holy cybernetics, believing that the weakness of organic matter is a flaw to be purged. They speak in binary cant, perform sacred rites to appease machine spirits, and view innovation with deep suspicion — for to them, all knowledge worth having was discovered in the distant past, during the Dark Age of Technology.

The Mechanicus fields its own armies of Skitarii warriors, towering Kastelan robots, and walking god-machines called Titans. While technically allied with the Imperium through the ancient Treaty of Mars, the Mechanicus operates with considerable autonomy, pursuing their Quest for Knowledge across the galaxy while supplying the Emperor's armies with the weapons they need to wage eternal war.
