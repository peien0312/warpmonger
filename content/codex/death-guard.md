The Death Guard are a Traitor Legion devoted to Nurgle, the Chaos God of plague and decay. Once the XIV Legion of the Emperor's Space Marines, they were led to damnation by their Primarch Mortarion during the Horus Heresy. Trapped in the warp and ravaged by supernatural plagues, the Death Guard embraced Nurgle's "gifts" and became walking plague hosts. Their bloated, rotting bodies are nearly impervious to pain, and they spread Nurgle's contagions wherever they tread. The Deathshroud are Mortarion's elite bodyguard, massive Terminators wielding manreapers and plaguespurter gauntlets, silent sentinels sworn to protect their Daemon Primarch at all costs.
