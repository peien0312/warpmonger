Magnus the Red, Primarch of the Thousand Sons and known as the Crimson King, was the most powerful psyker among the Emperor's sons. His single eye saw truths hidden from mortal sight, and his mastery of the Warp was unmatched. It was Magnus's attempt to warn the Emperor of Horus's treachery that inadvertently breached the psychic wards around Terra. The resulting catastrophe at Prospero, when Leman Russ brought the Space Wolves to destroy his Legion, drove Magnus to embrace Tzeentch and damnation.
