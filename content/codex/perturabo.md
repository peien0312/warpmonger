Perturabo, Primarch of the Iron Warriors, was the Lord of Iron and master of siege warfare. Brilliant but bitter, he felt his Legion's achievements were never properly recognized while other Primarchs received glory for flashier victories. His genius for architecture and engineering was matched only by his capacity for cold fury. When the Heresy came, Perturabo's resentment made him easy prey for Horus's recruitment, and he turned his formidable intellect to tearing down everything he once built. His weapon Forgebreaker could shatter fortifications, and his strategic mind broke worlds.
