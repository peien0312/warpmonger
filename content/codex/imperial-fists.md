The Imperial Fists are the VII Legion, founded by Rogal Dorn and renowned as the greatest siege masters in the Imperium. During the Horus Heresy, it was Dorn who fortified the Imperial Palace on Terra and held the walls against the traitor onslaught. The Imperial Fists' yellow armor marks them as stubborn defenders and methodical attackers, masters of fortification and siege warfare. Their gene-seed carries Dorn's uncompromising nature, and they pursue victory with an almost obsessive determination to never fail the Emperor.
