The Iron Hands are the X Legion, founded by the Primarch Ferrus Manus and renowned for their embrace of bionics and disdain for the weakness of flesh. After Ferrus Manus was slain by Fulgrim at the Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V, the Iron Hands developed an obsessive hatred of weakness that drove them to replace ever more of their bodies with mechanical augmentation. They believe that flesh is weak and only through the cold logic of the machine can perfection be achieved. Iron Hands Space Marines often have extensive bionic replacements, and their Chapter works closely with the Adeptus Mechanicus, sharing their reverence for technology.
