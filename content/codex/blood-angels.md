The Blood Angels are one of the most noble and tragic Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes, descended from the Primarch Sanguinius. Founded as the IX Legion during the Great Crusade, they are renowned for their artistic temperament, angelic beauty, and terrifying martial prowess — earning them the title "Angels of Death."

Yet the Blood Angels bear a terrible curse. When Sanguinius was slain by Horus during the Siege of Terra, his death left a psychic scar upon his gene-seed. All Blood Angels suffer from the Red Thirst, a vampiric craving for blood that they must constantly suppress. Worse still, some fall to the Black Rage, a psychic madness that causes them to relive their Primarch's final moments, losing themselves to berserk fury.

Despite their curse, the Blood Angels remain among the Imperium's most steadfast defenders. Their Chapter culture emphasizes art, beauty, and the pursuit of perfection — a bulwark against the darkness within. When they go to war, they do so with golden wings and crimson fury, embodying both the best and most tragic aspects of the Emperor's design.
