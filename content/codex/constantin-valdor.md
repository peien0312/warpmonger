Constantin Valdor was the first and greatest Captain-General of the Legio Custodes, the Emperor's most trusted guardian and one of the few beings in the Imperium who could speak directly to the Master of Mankind. His martial prowess was legendary even among the Custodians, and his tactical genius helped shape the defense of Terra during the Horus Heresy. He wielded the Apollonian Spear, a master-crafted weapon of extraordinary power.
