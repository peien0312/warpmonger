Imperial Knights are towering war machines piloted by Noble warriors from Knight Worlds scattered across the galaxy. These ancient suits of armor stand as tall as buildings and carry weapons capable of annihilating tanks and leveling fortifications. Each Knight House maintains feudal traditions dating back to the Dark Age of Technology, and their Nobles are mind-linked to their Knights through a neural interface called the Throne Mechanicum. Houses such as Terryn and Raven have served the Imperium for millennia, their Knights striding into battle alongside Space Marines and the Imperial Guard as living engines of destruction.
