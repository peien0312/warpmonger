The Black Templars are a Second Founding successor Chapter of the Imperial Fists, known for their eternal crusades and zealous hatred of the xenos, the mutant, and the heretic. Unlike other Chapters, the Black Templars maintain no homeworld and instead wage a galaxy-spanning crusade that has continued unbroken since their founding. They are among the most numerous of all Space Marine Chapters, their numbers estimated to exceed the Codex-mandated limit of one thousand warriors. Black Templars venerate the Emperor as a god and fight with fanatical devotion, their black armor marked with white crosses and chains of devotion. The Chapter is organized into numerous crusade fleets, each led by a Marshal who pursues his own campaign of conquest in the Emperor's name.
