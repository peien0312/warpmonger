The Black Legion is the largest and most feared of all Chaos Space Marine warbands, formed from the ashes of the Sons of Horus following the Horus Heresy. Led by Abaddon the Despoiler, the Warmaster of Chaos, the Black Legion has launched thirteen Black Crusades from the Eye of Terror, each bringing devastation to the Imperium. Unlike other Traitor Legions who retained their original colors, the Black Legion painted their armor black to symbolize their shame at Horus's defeat and their vow to succeed where he failed. The Legion welcomes warriors from all Traitor Legions and renegade Chapters, united under Abaddon's banner in their eternal war against the Imperium they once served.
