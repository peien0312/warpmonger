The Varagyr were the elite bodyguard of Leman Russ, the most savage and skilled warriors of the Space Wolves Legion. Clad in Cataphractii Terminator armor and wielding frost weapons of ancient Fenrisian design, they fought at the Wolf King's side in the most desperate battles. Only those warriors who had proven themselves in countless engagements and earned the Primarch's personal respect could join the Varagyr. Their name meant "slayers of kings" in the old tongue of Fenris.
