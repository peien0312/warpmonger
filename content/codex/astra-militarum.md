The Astra Militarum, formerly known as the Imperial Guard, is the largest military force in the galaxy — countless billions of soldiers raised from thousands of worlds to fight and die for the God-Emperor of Mankind. Where Space Marines are elite warriors, the Guardsmen of the Astra Militarum are ordinary humans armed with faith, lasguns, and sheer weight of numbers.

Each regiment reflects the culture of its homeworld: the disciplined Cadians, the siege specialists of Krieg, the jungle fighters of Catachan, and countless others. They fight alongside tanks, artillery, and aircraft, their massed firepower compensating for their individual fragility. The Guard's doctrine is simple — throw enough bodies at a problem until it stops being a problem.

The Astra Militarum forms the backbone of Imperial defense, holding the line across a million worlds. They face horrors that would break lesser men — Chaos daemons, alien monstrosities, heretical uprisings — and yet they stand, for they know that the Emperor protects, and that their sacrifice ensures humanity's survival for another day.
