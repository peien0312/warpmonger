title: Death Company
aliases: ["The Lost", "Black-armored Brethren"]

The Death Company is a unique and tragic formation within the Blood Angels Chapter and their successor Chapters, made up of Space Marines consumed by the psychic curse known as the Black Rage. These warriors have succumbed to visions of their Primarch Sanguinius's final battle against Horus, losing themselves to an overwhelming fury that blends past and present.

Upon falling to the Black Rage, a Battle-Brother is stripped of his Chapter heraldry and repainted in black armor marked with red crosses — the colors of mourning and sacrifice. They are gathered together under the guidance of the Chapter's Chaplains, particularly the Guardian of the Lost, who leads them in their final battles.

Death Company Marines are extraordinarily dangerous, their pain receptors dulled and their strength enhanced by their madness. They charge into battle seeking only death in the Emperor's service, often overwhelming enemies through sheer ferocity. Few survive more than a single engagement, and those who do are quietly granted the Emperor's Peace by their Chaplains. The Death Company represents both the Blood Angels' greatest shame and their most devastating weapon.
