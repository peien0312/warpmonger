The Iron Warriors were the IV Legion of the Space Marine Legions, masters of siege warfare and fortification. Under the command of their bitter Primarch Perturabo, they prosecuted the Great Crusade's most grinding campaigns, breaking fortress worlds and crushing resistance through methodical, relentless assault. Their expertise in siege warfare was unmatched, and their preference for heavy weapons and trench warfare made them the Imperium's breakers of walls. During the Horus Heresy, they turned their talents against their former brothers, their siege lines now encircling the Imperial Palace itself.
