Magistus Amon was one of the greatest captains of the Thousand Sons Legion, serving as equerry to Magnus the Red himself. A member of the elite Scarab Occult and master of the hidden arts, Amon was among the most trusted advisors of his Primarch. His psychic abilities and tactical acumen made him invaluable during the Great Crusade and the tragedy that befell the Legion at Prospero.
