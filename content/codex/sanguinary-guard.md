The Sanguinary Guard are the elite honor guard of the Blood Angels Chapter, warriors who protect the Chapter Master and serve as living symbols of Sanguinius's legacy. Clad in ancient artificer armor of burnished gold and equipped with magnificent angelic wings, they are the most glorious warriors of the Chapter. Each member carries an encarmine weapon — master-crafted power blades that glow with deadly energy — alongside wrist-mounted angelus boltguns or inferno pistols. The Sanguinary Guard fight with unmatched grace and ferocity, their golden forms sweeping through enemy formations like avenging angels. To be chosen for the Sanguinary Guard is the highest honor a Blood Angels warrior can receive, and they guard this duty with their lives.
