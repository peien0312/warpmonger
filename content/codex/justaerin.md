The Justaerin were the elite First Company of the Sons of Horus, comprising the Legion's finest Terminators. Clad in black Cataphractii armor to distinguish themselves from their brothers, these warriors served as Horus's personal guard and shock troops. Armed with devastating close-combat weapons including Carsoran power axes and thunder hammers, the Justaerin would teleport directly into the heart of enemy formations, cutting down commanders and breaking enemy morale with terrifying efficiency.
