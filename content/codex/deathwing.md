The Deathwing is the First Company of the Dark Angels Chapter, comprised exclusively of veterans clad in Terminator armor of bone-white. Unlike the dark green of their battle-brothers, the Deathwing's pale color commemorates a legendary battle where the entire company sacrificed themselves to save their homeworld. Only those who have proven themselves worthy — and who have been inducted into the Chapter's inner circle of secrets — may join the Deathwing. The Deathwing Knights are the elite within this elite, ceremonial warriors who guard the Chapter's greatest secrets and hunt the most dangerous of the Fallen. Armed with maces of absolution and storm shields, they are among the most formidable close combat warriors in the Imperium.
