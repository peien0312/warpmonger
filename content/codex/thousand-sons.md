The Thousand Sons were the XV Legion of the Space Marines, founded on Terra but transformed by their Primarch Magnus the Red into a Legion of scholar-warriors and psykers. Every battle-brother possessed some degree of psychic ability, making them unique among the Legions. They pursued knowledge and the mysteries of the Warp with obsessive dedication. During the Horus Heresy, the Space Wolves were dispatched to bring Magnus to account at Prospero, resulting in the near-destruction of the Legion and their fall to Chaos.
