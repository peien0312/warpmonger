The Alpha Legion, the XX Legion, were the last and most mysterious of the Space Marine Legions created during the Great Crusade. Masters of infiltration, misdirection, and covert operations, the Alpha Legion operated very differently from their brother Legions. Their twin Primarchs, Alpharius and Omegon, cultivated an air of secrecy that extended to their Legion's true allegiances during the Horus Heresy—even ten thousand years later, scholars debate which side they truly served. Their Headhunters and Lernaean Terminators are specialists in assassination and surgical strikes.
