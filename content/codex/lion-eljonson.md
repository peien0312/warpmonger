Lion El'Jonson, the First Primarch, is the legendary master of the Dark Angels Legion and one of the Emperor's twenty sons. Raised in the death world forests of Caliban, he grew to become one of the greatest warriors and strategists among the Primarchs. During the Horus Heresy, the Lion remained loyal to the Emperor but arrived at Terra too late to join the final battle. After the Heresy, he was betrayed by his closest friend Luther and fell into a mysterious slumber beneath the Rock. For ten thousand years he slept, but in the Era Indomitus, the Lion has finally awakened to lead his sons once more in humanity's darkest hour.
