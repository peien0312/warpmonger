The Lernaean Terminators served as the Alpha Legion's elite shock troops, equivalent to other Legions' First Company veterans. Clad in distinctive Cataphractii armor and armed with volkite chargers and power axes, these warriors specialized in decapitation strikes against enemy command structures. Named after the mythical Hydra of ancient Terra, the Lernaean embodied the Alpha Legion's doctrine of striking the head to kill the body, eliminating leaders to sow chaos among enemy forces.
