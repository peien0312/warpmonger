Rogal Dorn was the Primarch of the Imperial Fists Legion and one of the Emperor's most loyal sons. A master of defensive warfare, Dorn was chosen to fortify Terra itself against the traitor onslaught during the Horus Heresy. He stood beside the Emperor in the final battle aboard Horus's flagship and witnessed the terrible confrontation that left the Emperor interred upon the Golden Throne. After the Heresy, Dorn led the grief-stricken Imperial Fists in the Iron Cage against his hated rival Perturabo, and was eventually lost fighting a boarding action against a Chaos fleet — though his skeletal fist remains a relic of the Chapter to this day.
