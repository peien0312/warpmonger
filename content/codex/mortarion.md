Mortarion, the Death Lord, is the Daemon Primarch of the Death Guard and one of the most powerful servants of Nurgle. Once the stoic master of the XIV Legion, Mortarion turned traitor during the Horus Heresy, though even he resisted the embrace of Chaos until supernatural plagues broke his will. Now transformed into a towering daemon prince, Mortarion wields the ancient weapons Silence — his massive scythe — and the Lantern, a sidearm that projects beams of deadly energy. He commands the Death Guard from the Plague Planet, launching campaigns to spread Nurgle's gifts across the galaxy.
