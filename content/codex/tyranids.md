The Tyranids are an extragalactic swarm of alien organisms driven by an all-consuming hunger to devour all biomass in their path. Organized into vast Hive Fleets controlled by a gestalt consciousness called the Hive Mind, the Tyranids have no culture, no mercy, and no motivation beyond feeding. Hive Fleet Leviathan is one of the largest and most dangerous tendrils of the Great Devourer, currently threatening the Imperium from below the galactic plane. From tiny Rippers to massive Bio-Titans, every Tyranid organism exists only to serve the swarm, their bodies adapted for specific roles in the endless cycle of consumption and reproduction.
