Horus Aximand, known as "Little Horus" for his striking resemblance to his Primarch, served as Captain of the Sons of Horus 5th Company and was one of the four members of the Mournival, Horus's innermost circle of advisors. A skilled warrior and thoughtful strategist, Aximand struggled more than most with the moral implications of the Heresy but remained loyal to his Primarch despite his doubts. His internal conflict made him one of the more tragic figures of the XVI Legion.
