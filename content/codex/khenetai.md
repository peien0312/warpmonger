The Khenetai Occult Blades were elite swordsmen of the Thousand Sons Legion, warriors who combined psychic mastery with sublime blade-work. Each Khenetai was a skilled psyker whose precognitive abilities allowed them to anticipate enemy attacks and strike with supernatural precision. They wielded force-imbued blades that could cut through armor and flesh with equal ease, their weapons becoming extensions of their psychic will.
