The T'au Empire is a young and expansionist alien civilization that believes in the Greater Good — a philosophy of unity and cooperation that has drawn many species into their fold. Unlike the stagnant Imperium, the T'au embrace technological progress and have developed advanced battlesuits, pulse weaponry, and drone technology that rivals Imperial wargear. Their military is organized into Cadres led by experienced Commanders, with the Fire Caste providing warriors while other Castes support the war effort. Commander Shadowsun is their greatest living military leader, a tactical genius who has led the T'au's expansion deep into Imperial space.
