The Space Wolves are the VI Legion, fierce warriors from the death world of Fenris who embrace their savage nature rather than suppress it. Founded by Leman Russ, the Space Wolves disdain the Codex Astartes and maintain their own unique culture based on Fenrisian warrior traditions. They organize into Great Companies led by Wolf Lords, and their warriors undergo a transformation that gives them wolf-like senses and fangs. The Space Wolves were the Emperor's executioners, unleashed when a threat needed to be utterly destroyed. Bjorn the Fell-Handed is their oldest warrior, a Dreadnought who fought alongside Leman Russ himself ten thousand years ago.
