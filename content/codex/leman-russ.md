Leman Russ, Primarch of the Space Wolves and known as the Wolf King, was raised among the savage tribes of Fenris and became one of the Emperor's most fearsome executioners. Unlike his brothers' more refined approach to war, Russ embraced the primal fury of his home world, leading his Legion in devastating close-quarters assaults. Armed with the Sword of Balenight and the Axe of Helwinter, he was the Emperor's ultimate sanction against wayward brothers—famously chastening both Angron and Magnus during the Great Crusade.
