The Night Lords are a Chaos Space Marine Legion infamous for their use of terror, psychological warfare, and sadistic cruelty. Founded as the VIII Legion during the Great Crusade, they were created from gene-seed derived from their Primarch, Konrad Curze — the Night Haunter.

Curze was raised on the lawless hive world of Nostramo, where he imposed brutal order through fear and violence. This dark upbringing shaped both his Legion's tactics and their eventual fall to Chaos. The Night Lords specialized in terror operations, bringing worlds to compliance through horrific displays of violence rather than conventional warfare.

During the Horus Heresy, the Night Lords sided with the traitor Warmaster Horus, though more out of spite and nihilism than devotion to the Chaos Gods. After Curze's assassination by the Callidus assassin M'Shen, the Legion fragmented into numerous warbands that continue to terrorize the Imperium from the Eye of Terror. Unlike other Chaos Legions, the Night Lords largely reject daemon worship, preferring to rely on fear as their weapon.
