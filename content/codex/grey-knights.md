The Grey Knights are the secret Chapter of Space Marines created specifically to combat the daemonic. Every Grey Knight is a powerful psyker, and their very existence is known to only a handful of individuals in the entire Imperium. Operating from their fortress-monastery on Titan, the Grey Knights respond to daemonic incursions across the galaxy, their silver armor warded against corruption and their minds shielded against possession. The Nemesis Dreadknight is among their most devastating weapons — a towering battlesuit piloted by a Grey Knight that can go toe-to-toe with Greater Daemons and emerge victorious.
