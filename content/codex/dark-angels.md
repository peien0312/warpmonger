The Dark Angels are the First Legion, founded by the Emperor's hand and led by their Primarch Lion El'Jonson. They are among the most secretive of all Space Marine Chapters, haunted by a dark shame they have kept hidden for ten thousand years. During the Horus Heresy, fully half of their Legion turned traitor under Luther's leadership, and the Dark Angels have hunted these "Fallen" ever since. The Chapter is organized into specialized formations: the Deathwing, elite Terminators clad in bone-white armor, and the Ravenwing, fast-attack specialists riding jet-black bikes and speeders. The Dark Angels pursue their hidden agenda across the galaxy, abandoning allies and breaking oaths if it means capturing one of the Fallen — a truth they will kill to protect.
