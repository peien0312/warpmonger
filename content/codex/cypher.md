Cypher is one of the most mysterious figures in the galaxy, a hooded warrior who has stalked the Imperium for ten thousand years bearing a sword that may be the Lion Sword of the Dark Angels Primarch. His true identity and ultimate goals remain unknown, but he is relentlessly hunted by the Dark Angels Chapter who believe him to be one of the Fallen — Dark Angels who turned traitor during the Horus Heresy. Cypher appears at crucial moments across the galaxy, sometimes aiding the Imperium's enemies, sometimes fighting alongside its defenders. He carries two ancient pistols and fights with preternatural speed, vanishing before the Dark Angels can capture him. Some believe he seeks redemption on Terra; others think he plots the final downfall of his former Chapter.
