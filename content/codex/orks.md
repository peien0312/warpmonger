The Orks are a savage alien race that lives only for war, their entire culture built around fighting and conquest. These green-skinned brutes are among the most numerous species in the galaxy, and their ceaseless wars threaten every civilized world. Orks reproduce through spores, making them nearly impossible to eradicate completely. Their technology works through a combination of scavenging, intuition, and a latent psychic field that makes their ramshackle equipment function despite all logic. Kommandos are rare Orks who have mastered the art of sneaking and infiltration — at least by Ork standards — striking from ambush before the enemy knows they're under attack.
