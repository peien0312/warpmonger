Sigismund was the First Captain of the Imperial Fists during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, renowned throughout the Legiones Astartes as perhaps the greatest swordsman of his era. His skill in combat was so legendary that even Primarchs acknowledged his prowess. During the Siege of Terra, Sigismund led the Templars, an elite cadre of warriors who would eventually become the Black Templars Chapter. His faith in the Emperor bordered on religious fervor, and he would spend the millennia following the Heresy hunting traitors as the first High Marshal of the Black Templars.
