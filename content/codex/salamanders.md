The Salamanders are the XVIII Legion, founded by the Primarch Vulkan and renowned for their mastery of fire-based weapons and their unusually close bonds with the common people of the Imperium. Unlike other Space Marine Chapters who remain aloof from humanity, the Salamanders live among the people of their volcanic homeworld Nocturne, protecting them as shepherds guard their flock. Their onyx-black skin and glowing red eyes are mutations caused by their volcanic homeworld's radiation. The Salamanders are master artificers, crafting weapons and armor of exceptional quality, and they favor melta weapons and flamers that bring the cleansing fire of their homeworld to the enemies of mankind.
