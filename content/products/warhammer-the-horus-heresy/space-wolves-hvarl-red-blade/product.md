Hvarl Red-Blade was a legendary Jarl of the [[Space Wolves]], commander of Fyf Great Company and one of [[Leman Russ|Leman Russ's]] most trusted war leaders. His red-stained weapons earned him his fearsome epithet, and his tactical cunning made him invaluable during the burning of Prospero and the battles of the [[Horus Heresy]]. This figure depicts the savage warrior in his ornate armor, ready to lead his wolves into battle.
