Brother Nadael fights alongside his Intercessor squad as a line warrior of the [[Dark Angels]] Chapter. The Primaris Marines brought by [[Roboute Guilliman]] during the Indomitus Crusade have been integrated into the First Legion, though they remain unaware of the Chapter's darkest secrets until they prove themselves worthy. Nadael carries his bolt rifle with the stoic determination that defines the sons of [[Lion El'Jonson]], ever watchful for treachery.
