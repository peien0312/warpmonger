The Primaris Redemptor Dreadnought was introduced during the [[Indomitus Crusade]] as part of [[Belisarius Cawl]]'s innovations for the newly created Primaris Space Marines. Unlike older Castraferrum or Contemptor patterns, the Redemptor is a towering war machine designed specifically to match the enhanced physiology and battlefield needs of Primaris warriors. It serves as both a walking tank and a sarcophagus, housing mortally wounded Primaris Marines so they can continue fighting in service to the Emperor. First deployed alongside [[Guilliman]]'s crusading forces after the opening of the Great Rift, the Redemptor quickly became a staple of many Chapters, combining devastating ranged firepower with brutal close-combat capability and symbolizing the Imperium's relentless drive to keep its heroes fighting even beyond death.
