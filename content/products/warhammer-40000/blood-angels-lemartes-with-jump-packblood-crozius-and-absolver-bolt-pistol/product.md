Lemartes, Guardian of the Death Company * of the Blood Angels Chapter, is a Chaplain burdened by the curse of the Black Rage ** yet possessed of the strength to master it. Unlike his doomed brethren, he retains clarity enough to lead them into battle, transforming their madness into a weapon of faith and fury. Armed with the sacred Blood Crozius ***, Lemartes embodies both the spiritual authority of his Chaplaincy and the grim duty of guiding the lost, standing as a tragic yet indomitable figure within the Chapter.

* The Death Company is a unique and tragic formation within the Blood Angels Chapter, made up of Space Marines consumed by the psychic curse known as the Black Rage.

** A psychic curse that drives Blood Angels into berserk fury, reliving the death of their Primarch Sanguinius.

*** A sacred, power-wreathed relic that embodies his dual role as Chaplain and cursed shepherd of the Death Company, turning their madness into a weapon of faith and fury.
