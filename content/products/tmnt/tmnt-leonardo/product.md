Leonardo is the disciplined leader of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, wielding twin katanas with masterful precision. Trained in the art of ninjutsu by Master Splinter, he bears the blue mask and the heavy burden of leadership, guiding his brothers through countless battles against the Foot Clan and the forces of the Shredder. His unwavering sense of honor and tactical mind make him the heart of the team, always putting duty and family above all else.
