Raphael is the fiercest warrior among the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, his twin sai extensions of his volatile spirit. Wearing the red mask, he channels his aggression into devastating combat prowess that has broken countless Foot Clan ninjas. Though his temper often puts him at odds with Leonardo's measured leadership, Raphael's loyalty to his brothers is absolute — he would face any enemy, no matter how powerful, to protect his family.
